### Dependencies/Build
Requires npm and yarn.
Run the `yarn install` command in the resources/ft-base/ui directory and `npm install` in resources/ft-base.
Run `yarn build` or `npm build` in those same folders to build the UI and resource, respectively. Alternatively, open the resources folder in VSCode and use Ctrl+Shift+B.
You can also run `yarn start` in the ui directory to run a debug version of the UI in a browser.


### SQL
SQL files to create the MariaDB database are in the sql folder. Run them in HeidiSQL.
